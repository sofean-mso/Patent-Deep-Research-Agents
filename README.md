**Abstract**  
Advances in Large Language Models have enabled autonomous Deep Research agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks. Despite this, analyzing the vast technical knowledge in patents remains challenging due to information overload, specialized terminology, and the limits of traditional search methods. To address these constraints, we introduce the Patent Deep Research Agent (PDRA), a multi-agent AI system designed to automate the entire patent exploration workflow, accelerate scientific discovery, answering scientific questions, and generate in-depth analytical reports. The PDRA system operates through a modular, iterative architecture, integrating specialized agents—including Planning, Summarization, Re-ranker, Reflection, Analyzer, and Answering—each contributing to a comprehensive and structured research process. The PDRA supports two complementary research workflows: a document-centric approach for creating detailed, structured research reports with analysis and citations; and a passage-centric workflow that operates as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent to produce clear, concise, and citation-backed answers to scientific questions. This system supports researchers by accelerating scientific discovery, simplifying patent analysis, and delivering accurate, evidence-based insights into the vast and complex patent landscape.
