As will be explained in detail   the cold plasma treatment system may include a cold plasma applicator with one or more cold plasma generating regions and one or more massage treatment regions. In operation   the cold plasma applicator generates cold plasma at the cold plasma generation regions to treat a patient treatment site. The cold plasma may accelerate healing of the patient treatment site by killing bacteria   reducing inflammation   accelerating blood coagulation   facilitating the release of growth factors   etc. As the cold plasma generating regions produce cold plasma   the cold plasma applicator may be manipulated to move (e.g.   slide   roll   etc.) over the patient treatment site. As the cold plasma applicator moves over the patient treatment site   the massage treatment regions provide a massaging treatment that increases blood flow   increases joint flexibility   relaxes injured and overused muscles   etc. Depending on the embodiment   the distribution of the cold plasma generating regions and massage treatment regions may vary along the length of the cold plasma applicator to provide different types of massage and cold plasma treatments. For example   the cold plasma applicator may include interchangeable rollers that have different cold plasma generating regions and massaging treatment regions that enable a customized treatment of a patient treatment site. In some embodiments   the cold plasma applicator may be flexible to facilitate conforming to a patient treatment site. The cold plasma applicator may also include vibration elements and\/or heating elements to aid in treatment.#     # Passage ID# :# a9b850b0-9e4e-3ff5-8a45-412a39034b20#   # Patent No# :# US20170128117A1#   # PASSAGE# :# .
